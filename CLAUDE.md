# VenueX Platform

## Soul

VenueX is an integrated omnichannel operations and measurement platform for multi-location brands. It connects in-store data — locations, reviews, inventory, POS/CRM sales — to digital advertising platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok) so brands can prove which campaigns drive real store-level results.

**This repository is VenueX's product design environment.** Not production. Not a toy. It is a living, buildable specification — a polished frontend prototype that serves as the canonical reference for what every screen, component, interaction, and data contract should look like when engineering builds the real thing.

Two things are equally true here:
1. **It should look and feel like the real product.** Realistic layouts, polished interactions, believable mock data. If a developer opens this and can't tell it's a prototype, that's the goal.
2. **It should be architecturally ready to plug in.** Every endpoint stub, every TypeScript type, every mock response shape, every component contract — designed to lift directly into production with minimal refactoring.

## Who Is Building This

Kaan Acar — first employee at VenueX Bilisim Teknolojileri A.S. Product-builder who designs, decides, and ships in the same session. The work spans product management (scoping, specs, roadmap), product design (UX, layout, data presentation), and frontend engineering (building the prototype with AI-assisted development). These roles blur together by design — speed of iteration matters more than org chart boundaries.

**Communication style:** Simple, direct, everyday language. Turkish speaker. No fluff.

**Primary audience for this repo:** The engineering team. This prototype is their reference for exactly what to build.

## Design Environment Rules

### Plug-and-Play Principle
Nothing here is throwaway. Every feature built in this environment should be ready to connect to real backends:
- Endpoint stubs must match the real API contract shape
- Mock data must mirror the exact response structure production will return
- Component props must type the real data, not simplified versions
- State management patterns must scale to real async flows

### Token Index Convention
Every referenceable entity follows a consistent, traceable naming convention:

| Entity | Convention | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Endpoints** | `METHOD /api/{module}/{resource}` | `GET /api/locations`, `POST /api/offline-conversions/batches` |
| **Types** | `{Module}{Entity}` | `LocationProfile`, `OfflineConversionBatch`, `CampaignMetric` |
| **Components** | `{Module}{Feature}{Role}` | `LocationDataTable`, `OfflineSummaryCard`, `ReviewSentimentChart` |
| **Translation keys** | `{module}.{section}.{element}` | `overview.header.title`, `locations.table.storeName` |
| **Mock data files** | `mock-{module}-data.ts` | `mock-campaign-data.ts`, `mock-location-data.ts` |
| **Pages** | `{moduleName}.tsx` (kebab-case route) | `locations2.tsx` → `/locations`, `offline-conversionsMVP.tsx` → `/offline-conversions` |

When adding anything new, check existing naming patterns first. Consistency across the token index is non-negotiable — the engineering team needs to `Ctrl+F` any reference and find it everywhere.

### Mock Data Standards
- Use realistic Turkish market data: real brand names (Boyner, Koçtaş, Karaca), real city names (Istanbul districts), TRY currency
- Match rates, conversion values, and metrics should be plausible, not random
- Every mock dataset should include edge cases (empty states, error states, partial data)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query v5
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (new-york style) + MUI v7, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons

## Code Conventions

### Imports
Order: React/external libs → hooks/contexts → components → utilities/types → assets

```typescript
import { useLocation } from "wouter";
import { useLanguage } from "@/contexts/LanguageContext";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

### Components
- **Pages:** Function declarations with `export default`
- **UI primitives (shadcn):** `React.forwardRef` with named exports
- **Feature components:** Function declarations with `export default`
- **Utilities/formatters:** Arrow functions with named exports

### Styling
- Tailwind utility classes as primary styling method
- `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional/merged classes
- CSS variables for theming (defined in `index.css`)
- MUI ThemeProvider wraps the app (primary: `#3b82f6`, secondary: `#64748b`)

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state (currently backed by mock data service)
- React Context for language/i18n
- Local state for UI concerns

### Translations
- Access via `useLocales()` hook which returns `t('key.path')` function
- Supports nested keys: `t('overview.title')`
- Supports variables: `{{varName}}` or `{varName}` in translation strings
- Files: `client/src/lib/translations/en.json` and `tr.json`

## Database Schema (shared/schema.ts)

Tables: `users`, `platforms`, `locations`, `campaigns`, `metrics`, `enrichmentSuggestions`, `alerts`

Insert schemas generated via `drizzle-zod`. Types exported as `InsertUser`/`User`, `InsertPlatform`/`Platform`, etc.

## API Routes

Currently stub endpoints returning mock data messages:
- `GET /api/overview`
- `GET /api/metrics`
- `GET /api/enrichment-suggestions`
- `PATCH /api/enrichment-suggestions/:id`
- `DELETE /api/alerts/:id`

Frontend fetches are intercepted by the mock data service in `queryClient.ts`.

## Key Patterns

- **Mock data architecture:** All API calls go through `mockDataService` in `queryClient.ts` — no real backend calls yet
- **Route groups:** Standalone pages (onboarding, signup, welcome) render without sidebar; main app routes include sidebar + header
- **Sidebar:** Collapsible, auto-collapses on `/venuex-ai` route
- **Currency:** Turkish Lira (₺) via `fCurrency()`
- **Icons:** Lucide React as primary icon library
- **Notifications:** notistack snackbars via `toast` utility
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation
